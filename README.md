# Cmd + Food API

Am I the only one who shows up to the grocery store and goes through the same aisles multiple times trying to locate the items on my list? I hope not. Either way, I have a solution and it's called **Cmd + Food**. Using Kroger's API, a user can select their preferred location and build a grocery list based on what's available at their store. When it's time to begin shopping, the list will be compiled and grouped by aisle so you know exactly what you need as you move through the store!

This repository is the API I built in my final capstone at [NSS]([url](https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/)https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) using Python with Django. The client-side code built using React can be found [here]([url](https://github.com/RyanBeiden/cmd-food-client/tree/main)).

### Features

- Select a Kroger based on your location.
- Add the items you need to your list.
- When you choose to start shopping, your list will be broken down by aisle in order so you don't have to backtrace!
- Select items as you find them and they will be removed from your list.
